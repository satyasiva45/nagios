Configuration Of Hostgroups :: ($ is mentioned for user account)
----------------------------
Step 1: Create  a Hostgroup File

When you install the Nagios, It will not provide you default hostgroup file in the Nagios directory.

Here you need to first create a hostgroup file inside the “/usr/local/nagios/objects” directory where you will find all the Nagios configuration files.

Nagios configuration files has “.cfg” extension. We will create a file called “hostsgroup.cfg”

$vim /usr/local/nagios/objects/hostsgroup.cfg

define hostgroup {
           hostgroup_name    Remote_host
           alias             Remote_host
           members           nagios_host
         }

Example: #vim /usr/local/nagios/objects/hostsgroup.cfg
	 define hostgroup {
			hostgroup_name	 We-do-IT
			alias		 wdi
			members		 hydnb44,hydpc147(add hostnames to this members)
	}

Step 2: Give Permissions

Once you create hostsgroup.cfg file, it will create with a normal login user permissions. We need to change permissions with the required Nagios permissions. 

So that Nagios user will able to read the file.

$chown nagios:nagios hostsgroup.cfg (nagiosuser:nagiosuser)
$chmod 664 hostgroup.cfg

Step 3: Add Hostgroup File

Now you need to define the “hostsgroup.cfg” file in main nagios configuration file i.e. “nagios.cfg”.

When you define hostsgroup.cfg file nagios.cfg then nagios will be able to execute the defined parameters from hostsgroup.cfg file.

$vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

	#Add below line
	cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/hostsgroup.cfg

Save and close the file

Step 4: Verify Configuration & Restart Nagios Service

After all the necessary configuration changes, you need to check for syntax warnings and restart the Nagios service to reflect the newer changes on Nagios.

To check for errors & warning in configuration,

$/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg (for verifying configuration)

Restart Nagios Service,

$sysetmctl restart nagios.service
